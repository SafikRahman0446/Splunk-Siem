# Splunk-Siem
Splunk-based SOC project: log collection, dashboards, alerts, and reporting from Linux &amp; Windows servers.

# Splunk SIEM Project â€“ Log Monitoring & Visualization

This project demonstrates how to set up a Splunk SIEM solution for monitoring logs from both Windows and Ubuntu servers. It includes connecting agents, ingesting logs, building dashboards for visualization, and configuring alerts and reports for proactive security monitoring.

This project sets up Splunk Enterprise on an Ubuntu server and connects two Splunk Universal Forwarders (agents) â€” one from a Windows machine and one from another Ubuntu machine. Logs are collected centrally, visualized with dashboards, and analyzed through alerts and reports.
